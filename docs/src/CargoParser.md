# CargoParser.py

## Purpose
Parses the Cargo.json file generated by Elite Dangerous to track player ship cargo inventory. Provides methods to query cargo contents and monitor file changes.

## Key Classes/Functions
- CargoParser: Reads and manages cargo inventory from JSON file

## Key Methods
- get_cargo_data(): Loads current cargo data from JSON, caches if file unchanged
- get_item(item_name): Searches cargo for item by name (supports both internal and localized names), returns item dict or None
- get_items(): Returns list of all cargo items
- get_file_modified_time(): Returns file modification timestamp
- wait_for_file_change(start_timestamp, timeout): Polls file for changes, returns True if modified within timeout

## Data Format
- Cargo item: {Name, Name_Localised (optional), Count, Stolen}
- File location: %LOCALAPPDATA%/Frontier Developments/Elite Dangerous/Cargo.json (Windows)

## Dependencies
- os: File operations
- json: JSON parsing
- WindowsKnownPaths: Windows-specific path resolution
- EDlogger: Logging

## Notes
- Implements file caching with modification time checking to avoid unnecessary disk reads
- Retry logic with exponential backoff on file read errors
- Case-insensitive item name matching
- Supports both Windows and Linux paths
- Currently no active file monitoring thread (commented out)
